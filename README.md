# AfriDataHub - Yoruba Language Dataset Repository

Welcome to the AfriDataHub Yoruba repository! This repository is dedicated to building high-quality language datasets and natural language processing (NLP) tools for the Yoruba language, as part of AfriDataHubâ€™s mission to enhance digital inclusion for African languages. Our goal is to create resources that enable culturally relevant AI applications in Yoruba.

## Project Overview

The AfriDataHub initiative addresses the critical shortage of digital resources for African languages. This repository focuses on:
- Building parallel corpora for machine translation between Yoruba and English.
- Developing general language corpora to support NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets in multiple formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`).
- `scripts/`: Scripts for data preprocessing, annotation, and dataset preparation.
- `models/`: Pre-trained NLP models for Yoruba, such as machine translation and language models.
- `docs/`: Documentation on dataset creation, licensing, and ethical considerations.
- `community/`: Guidelines and resources for community contributions, including data collection and annotation guidelines.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the datasets and models for Yoruba, please refer to our [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md) for detailed instructions on accessing and utilizing these resources.

## Community Contributions

We welcome contributions from native speakers, linguists, and developers! You can support the project by:
1. Contributing language data (e.g., text samples, translations).
2. Annotating and validating datasets.
3. Sharing knowledge on Yoruba grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.

For guidelines on contributing, please refer to our [Contribution Guide](docs/contributing.md).
